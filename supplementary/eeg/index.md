## About

Equivariant enumerative geometry is the study of *classical enumerative geometry* in the presence of symmetry. To get started reading about this, I'd look at:
- Section 6 of this [survey paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04275) by me and Candace Bethea
- [*An enriched count of nodal orbits in an invariant pencil of conics*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08980) by Candace Bethea
- [*Equivariant enumerative geometry*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aim.2024.110082), B., 2025

Some people who are actively working on these ideas are myself, [Candace Bethea](https://sites.google.com/view/candacebethea), [Alberto Landi](https://sites.google.com/brown.edu/alberto-landi/home), and [Sidhanth Raman](https://www.svraman.com/).
