This course will look at algebraic manifolds from an algebraic topology perspective. It will be loosely based on Hirzebruch's 1956 text *Topological methods in algebraic geometry*, although we won't assume any background knowledge of algebraic geometry as a prerequisite. Topics we will cover include:
- sheaves on algebraic manifolds
- de Rham theorem
- fiber bundles and topological vector bundles
- characteristic classes (Chern, Stiefel-Whitney, Pontryagin)
- cobordism
- the Todd genus
- some basic Hodge theory
- Riemann-Roch for algebraic manifolds
