## Notes

Notes are regularly updated [on GitHub](https://github.com/tbrazel/math231br).
- [Local pdf](../../assets/coursenotes/math231br.pdf) (might be out of date at any given time, go to the GitHub for the most recent version)
- Here is [how to submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

If you're taking this class for credit, you will be responsible for contributing an appendix to the notes. Here is a [potential list of appendices](https://github.com/tbrazel/math231br/blob/main/potential_appendices.md) (I'll update this more throughout the semester).

## Content

This course will look at algebraic manifolds from an algebraic topology perspective. It will be loosely based on Hirzebruch's 1956 text *Topological methods in algebraic geometry*, although we won't assume any background knowledge of algebraic geometry as a prerequisite. Topics we will cover include:
- sheaves on algebraic manifolds, Cech cohomology
- the de Rham theorem
- fiber bundles and topological vector bundles
- characteristic classes (Chern, Pontryagin)
- oriented cobordism and the L-genus
- the index theorem
- complex cobordism and the Todd genus
- some basic Hodge theory
- Riemann-Roch for algebraic manifolds
