# About

I am a third-year NSF Postdoc at Harvard University, working with [Mike Hopkins](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~mjh/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to that, I was a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I was co-advised by [Mona Merling](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~mmerling/){:target="_blank"} and [Kirsten Wickelgren](https://sites.math.duke.edu/~kgw/index.html){:target="_blank"}. Starting in Spring 2027, I will be an Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University.


My CV is [here](/assets/misc/CV.pdf).

I work somewhere between algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, primarily in enumerative algebraic geometry and its enriched invariants. [More about my research here](/research/)

In Spring 2026 I am teaching [MATH231br](/teaching/26a_math231br), a second-semester grad course in algebraic topology - we're doing a Hirzebruch-flavored study of the topology of algebraic manifolds. Notes will be updated regularly on GitHub, and comments are very welcome!
